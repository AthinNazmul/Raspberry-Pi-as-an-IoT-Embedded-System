#  Introduction to the Raspberry Pi

## **1.1 What is a Raspberry Pi?**

 A Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit-card-sized computer that plugs into a monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It's a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing and learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.

 It's extremely popular with students, hobbyists, and professionals because it's affordable, portable, and has an exposed set of hardware pins (called GPIO pins) that let it interact with the physical world. This feature makes it perfect for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, robotics, and smart home projects.

## **1.2 Introducing Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**

 For this guide, we will be using the **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**, a powerful and versatile model in the Raspberry Pi family. It's more than capable of running a full desktop operating system (like Ubuntu) and handling complex projects, including lightweight AI.

### Here are its key components:![][image1]

* ### **Processor (CPU):** The "brain" of the computer. The Pi 4 has a powerful quad-core processor.

* ### **RAM:** This is the short-term memory. The Pi 4 comes in different RAM versions (e.g., 2GB, 4GB, 8GB). We recommend 4GB or more for a smooth desktop experience.

* ### **USB Ports:** Includes two blue **USB 3.0** ports (for fast devices like hard drives) and two **USB 2.0** ports (for your keyboard and mouse).

* ### **Ethernet Port:** For a wired internet connection.

* ### **Wi-Fi & Bluetooth:** Built-in for wireless networking.

* ### **Micro HDMI Ports:** Two small HDMI ports that allow you to connect up to two monitors.

* ### **USB-C Power Port:** How the Pi gets its power.

* ### **microSD Card Slot:** On the bottom of the Pi, this is where the "hard drive" (your SD card with the OS) goes.

* ### **GPIO Pins:** The 40-pin header. This is the most important part for our IoT projects.

## **1.3 What Can You Do With It?**

 The Raspberry Pi is a blank slate. You can turn it into almost anything, including:

*  **A Desktop PC:** By installing Ubuntu, you can use it for browsing the web, writing documents, and watching videos.

*  **A Learning Tool:** It's the best way to learn to code (especially Python) and understand how computers work with hardware.

*  **A Simple Web Server:** You can host your own website or a private cloud storage service.

*  **A Home Automation Hub:** Connect it to lights, speakers, and switches to control your home.

*  **An IoT Sensor Hub:** This is the focus of our guide. You can connect sensors to read temperature, motion, and distance, and then send that data to the internet.

*  **A Lightweight AI Device:** As we'll see in Chapter 7, you can run pre-trained AI models to perform tasks like image recognition.
